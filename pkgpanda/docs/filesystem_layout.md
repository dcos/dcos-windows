# File System Layout
pkgpanda packages expect a file system organized as described here so that symlinks
may be generated with the bootstrap tarball before actually being placed on the host system.

```bash
/etc/mesosphere/roles/{master,slave,slave_public}
/etc/mesosphere/setup-flags/
    repository-url
/etc/systemd/system/dcos.target.wants/
    mesos-master.service
/opt/mesosphere/
    bin/
    lib/
    include/
    etc/
    active/
        mesos -> /opt/mesosphere/packages/mesos--version
        marathon -> /opt/mesosphere/packages/marathon--version
    packages/
        mesos--version/
            dcos.target.wants_master/
                mesos-master.service
        marathon--version/
            dcos.target.wants_master/
                marathon.service
    active.buildinfo.full.json
    environment
    environment.export
```


## Package layout
Within each of the pkgpanda packages there are a few specific paths that must be generated during the package
build for the automatic activation linking to be effective

```bash
# Files generated by pkgpanda and not the user
buildinfo.full.json  # Expanded information describing the source and the specific versions
                     # of the dependencies it was built against
pkginfo.json         # json file describing list of pkgpanda pacakge dependencies
                     # Also lists environment variables to be loaded into the global environment.

# Directories and files picked up by automatic activation, but must be instantiated by the build process
etc/
bin/
lib/
dcos.target.wants/                # Units to be activated on all hosts
    foo.service                   # Actual unit to be linked to
dcos.target.wants_master/         # Master only units
dcos.target.wants_slave/          # Private agent only units
dcos.target.wants_slave_public/   # Public agent only units
```
